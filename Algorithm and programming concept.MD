# Algorithm and programming concept

## 1.Computational thinking
* Learning programming to solve questions involved a lot a repitition and computation.
* Every thing is a number. Numbers have types to show what do these numbers mean (int, double or char) and how to operate on them.  
Program is also number. Start as string and then turn into numbers by program.
* How is that a number? Images are made of pixels. Pixels are numbers, so we can do math on images.
* How to write a programm? First, find solution. Then, write down the solution step by step, generalize. In the end, using different input to check the algorithm.

## 2. Seven steps to programming.
  1. Solve small instance by hand (Problem should be clear enough, maybe need domain knowledge)
  2. Write what did step by step.
  3. Find patterns, generalization (repitition, condition and values). If fails, go back to step 1 and 2 wtih different inputs.
  4. check by hand. (check with different inputs)
  5. Translate into code. Run and check answer.
  6. Run test case.
  7. Debug failed test cases.
